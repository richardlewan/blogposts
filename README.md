# blogposts

More Android with Kotlin. This app pulls blog post data from a Rest API, and is my first attempt with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

This app uses:
* Dagger2 dependency injection
* Retrofit HTTP client; consume JSON and parse into objects
* Reactive Extensions (RxJava), as an elegant alternative to AsyncTask
* Observer/Observable pattern
* Data Binding and Mutable Live Data
